# General Dependencies

You will just need a live boot stick with Arch Linux.  
You can find more information on this here:  
- [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_medium)
- [Youtube Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb4fiFda4no)
  - It is done using a linux distro but the GUI interface should be the same as windows

# Guide

As for my preference to install Arch Linux, I mainly go for a very standard installation, following very closely to the Arch Wiki Installation Guide.
You may find that I do things in a different order, mainly due to preference.
The only things I really change are how I connect to the internet and the option for dual boot.  

**Note:*** I will not be showing screenshots of the installation phase (As it does not have a GUI then anyway), instead I will be showing the bash commands to act as references.
This guide is mainly targetted at intermediate and advanced users of Arch Linux.

## Connecting to the internet

Depending on whether you are connected to Wifi or Ethernet, how you connect to the internet here will defer.
As such I will leave it to you to connect to the internet.
